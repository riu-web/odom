## Introduction

A component-based JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It is highly flexible and compatible with other frameworks and libraries. You can easily integrate it in existing projects or use it to create a web app from scratch. The framework provides a number of ways to manage resources in terms of reusability, loading and more. It provides built in support for middleware, allowing you to extend its functionality easily. Acom provides both declarative and procedural ways of building user interfaces.

## Features

### Components

Acom is a component-based framework. You get most of the functionality by using components. However, it is possible to work with Acom without using component.

### Asset Management

Acom provides asset management capabilities to enable you to get assets, use them only when needed and reuse them. Ways of asset management in Acom include:

1. __Importing__: Acom provides ways for you to import modules and other assets like markup, styles and text.
2. __Prefetching__: You can prefetch assets like components, nodes, markup, text and more.
3. __Conditional Loading__: You can defer the loading of DOM elements, lazily load elements and choose not to load some elements at all if the conditions you specify are met.
4. __Reusability__: You can reuse components, DOM nodes, markup, text and styles.

### Compatibility

You can easily integrate Acom into existing projects. Acom also works well with other fron-end frameworks and libraries in its category and related categories.

### Flexibility

Acom offers a lot of flexibility including the following:

1. __Markup__: You can use HTML, XML or any XML-compliant markup language. You are also provided with some flexibility on how the markup you write in non-HTML languages gets converted to HTML. This makes it easier for you to ship and reuse code from already existing code bases in native platforms and the like.
2. __Styles__: You can use inline, internal and external styles.
3. __Components__: You can create components that are local to a file (script or module), single-file components (using ES modules or HTML files) or multiple-file components (using seperate files for markup, styles and JavaScript code). You can also choose to create and manipulate components using either declarative or procedural means.
4. __Middleware__: Acom allows you to use middleware for markup and styles processing. These middleware can either supplement or override the default processes used by Acom. This offers you a lot of room for you to use user-defined or third-party utilities.
