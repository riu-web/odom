## Introduction

A JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It is highly flexible and compatible with other frameworks and libraries.

## Features

### Asset Management

Odom provides asset management capabilities to enable you to get assets, use them only when needed and reuse them. Ways of asset management in Odom include:

1. **Importing**: Odom provides ways for you to import modules and other assets like markup and styles.
2. **Prefetching**: You can prefetch assets like components, markup, styles and more.
3. **Conditional Loading**: You can delay the loading of DOM elements, lazily load elements and choose not to load some elements at all if the conditions you specify are met.
4. **Reusability**: You can reuse components, DOM nodes, markup, text and styles.

### Compatibility

You can easily integrate Odom into existing projects. Odom also works well with other front-end frameworks and libraries in its category and in related categories.

### Flexibility

Odom offers a lot of flexibility including the following:

1. **Markup**: You can use HTML, XML or any XML-compliant markup language. You are also provided with some flexibility on how the markup you write in non-HTML languages gets converted to HTML. This makes it easier for you to reuse code from already existing code bases in native platforms and the like.
2. **Styles**: You can use inline, internal and external styles.
3. **Components**: You can create components of the following types:
   1. Local Components: Local to a script or module.
   2. Single-file Components: Using ES modules or HTML files.
   3. Multiple-file Components: Using separate files for markup, styles and main JavaScript code.
4. **Middleware**: Odom allows you to use middleware for processing markup and styles. These middleware can either supplement or override the default processes used by Odom. This offers you a lot of room for you to use user-defined or third-party utilities.
