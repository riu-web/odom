## Introduction

A component-based JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It is highly flexible and compatible with other frameworks and libraries. Acom provides both declarative and procedural ways of building user interfaces.

## Features

### Components

Acom is a component-based framework. You get most of the functionality by using components. However, it is possible to work with Acom without using component.

### Asset Management

Acom provides asset management capabilities to enable you to get assets, use them only when needed and reuse them. Ways of asset management in Acom include:

1. __Importing__: Acom provides ways for you to import modules and other assets like markup and styles.
2. __Prefetching__: You can prefetch assets like components, nodes, markup and more.
3. __Conditional Loading__: You can defer the loading of DOM elements, lazily load elements and choose not to load some elements at all if the conditions you specify are met.
4. __Reusability__: You can reuse components, DOM nodes, markup, text and styles.

### Compatibility

You can easily integrate Acom into existing projects. Acom also works well with other front-end frameworks and libraries in its category and related categories.

### Flexibility

Acom offers a lot of flexibility including the following:

1. __Markup__: You can use HTML, XML or any XML-compliant markup language. You are also provided with some flexibility on how the markup you write in non-HTML languages gets converted to HTML. This makes it easier for you to ship and reuse code from already existing code bases in native platforms and the like.
2. __Styles__: You can use inline, internal and external styles.
3. __Components__: You can create components of the following types:
   1. Local Components: Local to a script or module.
   2. Single-file Components: Using ES modules or HTML files.
   3. Multiple-file Components: Using seperate files for markup, styles and JavaScript code.
4. __Middleware__: Acom allows you to use middleware for processing markup and styles. These middleware can either supplement or override the default processes used by Acom. This offers you a lot of room for you to use user-defined or third-party utilities.
