## Introduction

A JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It is highly flexible and compatible with other frameworks and libraries.

## Features

### Compatibility

Odom is very compatible with other frameworks and libraries. You can easily integrate Odom into existing projects. You can also easily integrate components you create using other technologies into Odom.

### Flexibility

You can use HTML or XML to write markup. Odom supports styles used at element, component and global levels. You can create components in various ways. You can create single-file components using either ES modules or HTML files.
