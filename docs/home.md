## Introduction

A component-based JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It is highly flexible and compatible with other frameworks and libraries. You can easily integrate it in existing projects or use it to create a web app from scratch. The framework provides a number of ways to manage resources in terms of reusability, loading and more. It provides built in support for middleware, allowing you to extend its functionality easily. Acom provides both declarative and procedural ways of building user interfaces.

## Assumptions

The documentation assumes that you have at least intermediate understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In JavaScript, at least a fair understanding of modern JavaScript especially ECMAScript (ES) modules and asynchronous programing is required.

## Quick Start
