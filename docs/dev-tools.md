## Introduction

## Template Literals

Template strings in JavaScript can be used to easily write domain specific languages. In Acom, template strings can be used to write markup and styles. However, code editors usually do not provide syntax highlighting, intellisense and the like for template literals. Let us look at some tools you can use so that you have access to such development features in code editors.

### Visual Strudio Code

If you are using VSCode, you might find the following tools quite useful:

- [Comment Tagged Templates](): Used for syntax highlighting.
- [Template Literal Editor](): Used for editing code in template literals while having access to syntax highlighting, intellisense, auto-completion and more.
