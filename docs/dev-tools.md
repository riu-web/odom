# Development Tools

## Introduction

## Template Literals

Template literals in JavaScript can be used to easily write code in other languages. In Odom, template literals can be used to write markup and styles. However, code editors usually do not provide syntax highlighting, intellisense and the like for template literals. Let us look at some tools you can use so that you have access to such development features in code editors.

### Visual Studio Code

If you are using VSCode, you might find the following tools useful:

- [Comment Tagged Templates](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.comment-tagged-templates): Used for syntax highlighting.
- [Template Literal Editor](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=plievone.vscode-template-literal-editor): Used for editing code in template literals while having access to syntax highlighting, intellisense, auto-completion and more.
